## Model Overview

Duo is a full-duplex multimodal world model for real-time audio-visual interaction. This repository contains the FP8-quantized four-step distilled Realization weights for Duo 1.0.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Version | Duo 1.0 |
| Variant | FP8-quantized four-step distilled Realization |
| Package | Realization overlay |
| Realization format | ModelOpt FP8, per-channel scaling |
| Base dependency | `inclusionAI/Duo-1.0-causal-base` |
| Default sampler | Euler, 4 steps, flow shift 5.0 |

## Usage

Download the complete Duo 1.0 causal-base bundle, then overlay these Realization weights into the same directory:

```bash
hf download inclusionAI/Duo-1.0-causal-base --local-dir weights
hf download inclusionAI/Duo-1.0-distill-quant --local-dir weights
```

The shared Intent, codecs, speech models, and Realization backbone are supplied by the causal-base bundle. The consuming runtime must support the packaged ModelOpt FP8 format or an equivalent conversion path.

For code, configuration, and runtime-specific integration instructions, see [inclusionAI/Duo](https://github.com/inclusionAI/Duo).

## License

These weights were initialized from MiniMax H3 and subsequently trained by the Duo team. See [LICENSE](./LICENSE) and [NOTICE](./NOTICE) for the applicable terms.
